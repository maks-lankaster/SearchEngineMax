old spencer started nodding again  he also started picking his nose  he made out like he was only pinching it but he was really getting the old thumb right in there  i guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room  i didnt care except that its pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose 
then he said i had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had their little chat with dr  thurmer some weeks ago  theyre grand people 
yes they are  theyre very nice 
grand  theres a word i really hate  its a phony  i could puke every time i hear it 
then all of a sudden old spencer looked like he had something very good something sharp as a tack to say to me  he sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around  it was a false alarm though  all he did was lift the atlantic monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed next to me  he missed  it was only about two inches away but he missed anyway  i got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed  all of a sudden then i wanted to get the hell out of the room  i could feel a terrific lecture coming on  i didnt mind the idea so much but i didnt feel like being lectured to and smell vicks nose drops and look at old spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time  i really didnt 
it started all right  whats the matter with you boy old spencer said  he said it pretty tough too for him  how many subjects did you carry this term
five sir 
five  and how many are you failing in
four  i moved my ass a little bit on the bed  it was the hardest bed i ever sat on  i passed english all right i said because i had all that beowulf and lord randal my son stuff when i was at the whooton school  i mean i didnt have to do any work in english at all hardly except write compositions once in a while 
he wasnt even listening  he hardly ever listened to you when you said something 
i flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing 
i know that sir  boy i know it  you couldnt help it 
absolutely nothing he said over again  thats something that drives me crazy  when people say something twice that way after you admit it the first time  then he said it three times  but absolutely nothing  i doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term  did you tell the truth boy
