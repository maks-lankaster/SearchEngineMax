if you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where i was born  an what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that david copperfield kind of crap  but i don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  in the first place  that stuff bores me  and in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if i told anything pretty personal about them  they re quite touchy about anything like that  especially my father  they re nice and all  i m not saying that  but they re also touchy as hell  besides  i m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything  i ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last christmas just before i got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy  i mean that s all i told d b  about  and he s my brother and all  he s in hollywood  that isn t too far from this crumby place  and he comes over and visits me practically every week end  he s going to drive me home when i go home next month maybe  he just got a jaguar  one of those little english jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour  it cost him damn near four thousand bucks  he s got a lot of dough  now  he didn t use to  he used to be just a regular writer  when he was home  he wrote this terrific book of short stories  the secret goldfish  in case you never heard of him  the best one in it was the secret goldfish  it was about this little kid that wouldn t let anybody look at his goldfish because he d bought it with his own money  it killed me  now he s out in hollywood  d b   being a prostitute  if there s one thing i hate  it s the movies  don t even mention them to me 
where i want to start telling is the day i left pencey prep  pencey prep is this school that s in agerstown  pennsylvania  you probably heard of it  you ve probably seen the ads  anyway  they advertise in about a thousand magazines  always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence  like as if all you ever did at pencey was play polo all the time  i never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place  and underneath the guy on the horse s picture  it always says: since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid  clear-thinking young men  strictly for the birds  they don t do any damn more molding at pencey than they do at any other school  and i didn t know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all  maybe two guys  if that many  and they probably came to pencey that way
