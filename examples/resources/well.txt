well i sort of glanced through it a couple of times i told him  i didnt want to hurt his feelings  he was mad about history 
you glanced through it eh he said  very sarcastic  your ah exam paper is over there on top of my chiffonier  on top of the pile  bring it here please 
it was a very dirty trick but i went over and brought it over to him  i didnt have any alternative or anything  then i sat down on his cement bed again  boy you cant imagine how sorry i was getting that id stopped by to say good-by to him 
he started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something  we studied the egyptians from november 4th to december 2nd he said  you chose to write about them for the optional essay question  would you care to hear what you had to say
no sir not very much i said 
he read it anyway though  you cant stop a teacher when they want to do something  they just do it 
the egyptians were an ancient race of caucasians residing in one of the northern sections of africa  the latter as we all know is the largest continent in the eastern hemisphere 
i had to sit there and listen to that crap  it certainly was a dirty trick 
the egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for various reasons  modern science would still like to know what the secret ingredients were that the egyptians used when they wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for innumerable centuries  this interesting riddle is still quite a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century 
he stopped reading and put my paper down  i was beginning to sort of hate him  your essay shall we say ends there he said in this very sarcastic voice  you wouldnt think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all  however you dropped me a little note at the bottom of the page he said 
i know i did i said  i said it very fast because i wanted to stop him before he started reading that out loud  but you couldnt stop him  he was hot as a firecracker 
dear mr  spencer [he read out loud]  that is all i know about the egyptians  i cant seem to get very interested in them although your lectures are very interesting  it is all right with me if you flunk me though as i am flunking everything else except english anyway
