i ran all the way to the main gate  and then i waited a second till i got my breath  i have no wind  if you want to know the truth  i m quite a heavy smoker  for one thing  that is  i used to be  they made me cut it out  another thing  i grew six and a half inches last year  that s also how i practically got t b  and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff  i m pretty healthy  though 
anyway  as soon as i got my breath back i ran across route 204  it was icy as hell and i damn near fell down  i don t even know what i was running for  i guess i just felt like it  after i got across the road  i felt like i was sort of disappearing  it was that kind of a crazy afternoon  terrifically cold  and no sun out or anything  and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road 
boy  i rang that doorbell fast when i got to old spencer s house  i was really frozen  my ears were hurting and i could hardly move my fingers at all  c mon  c mon  i said right out loud  almost  somebody open the door  finally old mrs  spencer opened it  they didn t have a maid or anything  and they always opened the door themselves  they didn t have too much dough 
holden! mrs  spencer said  how lovely to see you! come in  dear! are you frozen to death i think she was glad to see me  she liked me  at least  i think she did 
boy  did i get in that house fast  how are you  mrs  spencer i said  how s mr  spencer
let me take your coat  dear  she said  she didn t hear me ask her how mr  spencer was  she was sort of deaf 
she hung up my coat in the hall closet  and i sort of brushed my hair back with my hand  i wear a crew cut quite frequently and i never have to comb it much  how ve you been  mrs  spencer i said again  only louder  so she d hear me 
i ve been just fine  holden  she closed the closet door  how have you been the way she asked me  i knew right away old spencer d told her i d been kicked out 
fine  i said  how s mr  spencer he over his grippe yet
over it! holden  he s behaving like a perfect  i don t know what… he s in his room  dear  go right in
