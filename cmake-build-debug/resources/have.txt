have a seat there boy old spencer said  he meant the bed 
i sat down on it  hows your grippe sir
mboy if i felt any better id have to send for the doctor old spencer said  that knocked him out  he started chuckling like a madman  then he finally straightened himself out and said why arent you down at the game i thought this was the day of the big game 
it is  i was  only i just got back from new york with the fencing team i said  boy his bed was like a rock 
he started getting serious as hell  i knew he would  so youre leaving us eh he said 
yes sir  i guess i am 
he started going into this nodding routine  you never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old spencer did  you never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all or just because he was a nice old guy that didnt know his ass from his elbow 
what did dr  thurmer say to you boy i understand you had quite a little chat 
yes we did  we really did  i was in his office for around two hours i guess 
whatd he say to you
oh… well about life being a game and all  and how you should play it according to the rules  he was pretty nice about it  i mean he didnt hit the ceiling or anything  he just kept talking about life being a game and all  you know 
life is a game boy  life is a game that one plays according to the rules 
yes sir  i know it is  i know it 
game my ass  some game  if you get on the side where all the hot-shots are then its a game all right  ill admit that  but if you get on the other side where there arent any hot-shots then whats a game about it nothing  no game  has dr  thurmer written to your parents yet old spencer asked me 
he said he was going to write them monday 
have you yourself communicated with them
no sir i havent communicated with them because ill probably see them wednesday night when i get home 
and how do you think theyll take the news
well… theyll be pretty irritated about it i said  they really will  this is about the fourth school ive gone to  i shook my head  i shake my head quite a lot  boy! i said  i also say boy! quite a lot  partly because i have a lousy vocabulary and partly because i act quite young for my age sometimes  i was sixteen then and im seventeen now and sometimes i act like im about thirteen  its really ironical because im six foot two and a half and i have gray hair  i really do  the one side of my head  the right side  is full of millions of gray hairs  ive had them ever since i was a kid  and yet i still act sometimes like i was only about twelve  everybody says that especially my father  its partly true too but it isnt all true  people always think somethings all true  i dont give a damn except that i get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age  sometimes i act a lot older than i am  i really do  but people never notice it  people never notice anything
