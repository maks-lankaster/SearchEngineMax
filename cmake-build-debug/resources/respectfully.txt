respectfully yours holden caulfield 
he put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like hed just beaten hell out of me in ping-pong or something  i dont think ill ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud  i wouldntve read it out loud to him if hed written it  i really wouldnt  in the first place id only written that damn note so that he wouldnt feel too bad about flunking me 
do you blame me for flunking you boy he said 
no sir! i certainly dont i said  i wished to hell hed stop calling me boy all the time 
he tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it  only he missed again naturally  i had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the atlantic monthly  its boring to do that every two minutes 
what would you have done in my place he said  tell the truth boy 
well you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me  so i shot the bull for a while  i told him i was a real moron and all that stuff  i told him how i wouldve done exactly the same thing if id been in his place and how most people didnt appreciate how tough it is being a teacher  that kind of stuff  the old bull 
the funny thing is though i was sort of thinking of something else while i shot the bull  i live in new york and i was thinking about the lagoon in central park down near central park south  i was wondering if it would be frozen over when i got home and if it was where did the ducks go  i was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over  i wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something  or if they just flew away 
im lucky though  i mean i could shoot the old bull to old spencer and think about those ducks at the same time  its funny  you dont have to think too hard when you talk to a teacher  all of a sudden though he interrupted me while i was shooting the bull  he was always interrupting you 
how do you feel about all this boy id be very interested to know  very interested 
you mean about my flunking out of pencey and all i said  i sort of wished hed cover up his bumpy chest  it wasnt such a beautiful view 
if im not mistaken i believe you also had some difficulty at the whooton school and at elkton hills  he didnt say it just sarcastic but sort of nasty too
