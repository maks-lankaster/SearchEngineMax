the other reason i wasn t down at the game was because i was on my way to say good-by to old spencer  my history teacher  he had the grippe  and i figured i probably wouldn t see him again till christmas vacation started  he wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before i went home  he knew i wasn t coming back to pencey 
i forgot to tell you about that  they kicked me out  i wasn t supposed to come back after christmas vacation on account of i was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all  they gave me frequent warning to start applying myself  especially around midterms  when my parents came up for a conference with old thurmer  but i didn t do it  so i got the ax  they give guys the ax quite frequently at pencey  it has a very good academic rating  pencey  it really does 
anyway  it was december and all  and it was cold as a witch s teat  especially on top of that stupid hill  i only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything  the week before that  somebody d stolen my camel s-hair coat right out of my room  with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all  pencey was full of crooks  quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families  but it was full of crooks anyway  the more expensive a school is  the more crooks it has  i m not kidding  anyway  i kept standing next to that crazy cannon  looking down at the game and freezing my ass off  only  i wasn t watching the game too much  what i was really hanging around for  i was trying to feel some kind of a good-by  i mean i ve left schools and places i didn t even know i was leaving them  i hate that  i don t care if it s a sad good-by or a bad goodby  but when i leave a place i like to know i m leaving it  if you don t  you feel even worse 
i was lucky  all of a sudden i thought of something that helped make me know i was getting the hell out  i suddenly remembered this time  in around october  that i and robert tichener and paul campbell were chucking a football around  in front of the academic building  they were nice guys  especially tichener  it was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out  but we kept chucking the ball around anyway  it kept getting darker and darker  and we could hardly see the ball any more  but we didn t want to stop doing what we were doing  finally we had to  this teacher that taught biology  mr  zambesi  stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner  if i get a chance to remember that kind of stuff  i can get a good-by when i need one  at least  most of the time i can  as soon as i got it  i turned around and started running down the other side of the hill  toward old spencer s house  he didn t live on the campus  he lived on anthony wayne avenue
