anyway  it was the saturday of the football game with saxon hall  the game with saxon hall was supposed to be a very big deal around pencey  it was the last game of the year  and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old pencey didn t win  i remember around three o clock that afternoon i was standing way the hell up on top of thomsen hill  right next to this crazy cannon that was in the revolutionary war and all  you could see the whole field from there  and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place  you couldn t see the grandstand too hot  but you could hear them all yelling  deep and terrific on the pencey side  because practically the whole school except me was there  and scrawny and faggy on the saxon hall side  because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them 
there were never many girls at all at the football games  only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them  it was a terrible school  no matter how you looked at it  i like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while  even if they re only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something  old selma thurmer  she was the headmaster s daughter  showed up at the games quite often  but she wasn t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire  she was a pretty nice girl  though  i sat next to her once in the bus from agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation  i liked her  she had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place  but you felt sort of sorry for her  what i liked about her  she didn t give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was  she probably knew what a phony slob he was 
the reason i was standing way up on thomsen hill  instead of down at the game  was because i d just got back from new york with the fencing team  i was the goddam manager of the fencing team  very big deal  we d gone in to new york that morning for this fencing meet with mcburney school  only  we didn t have the meet  i left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway  it wasn t all my fault  i had to keep getting up to look at this map  so we d know where to get off  so we got back to pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime  the whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train  it was pretty funny  in a way
