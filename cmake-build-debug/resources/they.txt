they each had their own room and all  they were both around seventy years old or even more than that  they got a bang out of things though  in a half-assed way of course  i know that sounds mean to say but i dont mean it mean  i just mean that i used to think about old spencer quite a lot and if you thought about him too much you wondered what the heck he was still living for  i mean he was all stooped over and he had very terrible posture and in class whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him  thats awful in my opinion  but if you thought about him just enough and not too much you could figure it out that he wasnt doing too bad for himself  for instance one sunday when some other guys and i were over there for hot chocolate he showed us this old beat-up navajo blanket that he and mrs  spencerd bought off some indian in yellowstone park  you could tell old spencerd got a big bang out of buying it  thats what i mean  you take somebody old as hell like old spencer and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket 
his door was open but i sort of knocked on it anyway just to be polite and all  i could see where he was sitting  he was sitting in a big leather chair all wrapped up in that blanket i just told you about  he looked over at me when i knocked  whos that he yelled  caulfield come in boy  he was always yelling outside class  it got on your nerves sometimes 
the minute i went in i was sort of sorry id come  he was reading the atlantic monthly and there were pills and medicine all over the place and everything smelled like vicks nose drops  it was pretty depressing  im not too crazy about sick people anyway  what made it even more depressing old spencer had on this very sad ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something  i dont much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway  their bumpy old chests are always showing  and their legs  old guys legs at beaches and places always look so white and unhairy  hello sir i said  i got your note  thanks a lot  hed written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started on account of i wasnt coming back  you didnt have to do all that  id have come over to say good-by anyway
