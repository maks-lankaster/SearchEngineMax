i didnt have too much difficulty at elkton hills i told him  i didnt exactly flunk out or anything  i just quit sort of 
why may i ask
why oh well its a long story sir  i mean its pretty complicated  i didnt feel like going into the whole thing with him  he wouldnt have understood it anyway  it wasnt up his alley at all  one of the biggest reasons i left elkton hills was because i was surrounded by phonies  thats all  they were coming in the goddam window  for instance they had this headmaster mr  haas that was the phoniest bastard i ever met in my life  ten times worse than old thurmer  on sundays for instance old haas went around shaking hands with everybodys parents when they drove up to school  hed be charming as hell and all  except if some boy had little old funny-looking parents  you shouldve seen the way he did with my roommates parents  i mean if a boys mother was sort of fat or corny-looking or something and if somebodys father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes then old hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then hed go talk for maybe a half an hour with somebody elses parents  i cant stand that stuff  it drives me crazy  it makes me so depressed i go crazy  i hated that goddam elkton hills 
old spencer asked me something then but i didnt hear him  i was thinking about old haas  what sir i said 
do you have any particular qualms about leaving pencey
oh i have a few qualms all right  sure… but not too many  not yet anyway  i guess it hasnt really hit me yet  it takes things a while to hit me  all im doing right now is thinking about going home wednesday  im a moron 
do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy
oh i feel some concern for my future all right  sure  sure i do  i thought about it for a minute  but not too much i guess  not too much i guess 
you will old spencer said  you will boy  you will when its too late 
i didnt like hearing him say that  it made me sound dead or something  it was very depressing  i guess i will i said 
id like to put some sense in that head of yours boy  im trying to help you  im trying to help you if i can
